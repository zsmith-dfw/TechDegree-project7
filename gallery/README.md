This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

First, create a file in the Components folder called "config.js". You will need to enter the following code:

const apiKey = 'YOUR FLICKR API KEY';
export default apiKey;

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Use
Simply generates random images based on the three default links of Trains, Planes, and Automobiles ( a nod to the movie!). Users can also enter their own custom image in the search bar. The Flickr API key can be customized at the users discretion. More information can be found at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/.
